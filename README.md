# Password Cracking Script

This script is designed to crack a password hash by comparing it to a list of potential passwords. It is important to note that this script should not be used for illegal or unethical purposes, and that the success rate of cracking a password depends on the quality and size of the provided password list.


## Requirements

* Node.js
* The 'fs' and 'crypto' modules for Node.js

## How it works

* The script reads the provided password list text file using the Node.js 'fs' module.
* It then takes each password from the list and hashes it using the Node.js 'crypto' module and the SHA-512 algorithm.
* The resulting hash is compared to a known hash.
* If the hash of a potential password matches the known hash, it is considered the correct password and is printed to the console.
* If no match is found, it will keep trying the next word from the list.

## Steps to prevent password cracking:

* Use a strong and unique password: Avoid using easily guessable information like your name or birthdate. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
* Use a password manager: A password manager can generate and store strong and unique passwords for you.
* Use two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.
* Keep your software updated: Software updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
* Be cautious of phishing scams: Be suspicious of unsolicited messages and do not click on links or enter personal information unless you are certain the source is trustworthy.
* Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts: If one account is compromised, all of your other accounts using the same password are also at risk.

By following these steps, you can greatly reduce the chances of your password being cracked, and help to keep your information secure.
